::: callout-note
I designed this course and taught it 2 times from Spring 2022 through 2023.
:::

The course is focused on the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments on human learning and cognition. In the first part of the course, we'll critically read and discuss published experiments focusing on the assumptions, limitations, and strengths of their methods, including papers on language, memory, learning and transfer, decision making, and reasoning. This will be supplemented with more philosophical readings on psychological science. In the second part of the course, students work with the course instructor and their advisor to design a novel pilot experiment that directly applies methodological knowledge to their own research area. The final product will include a pilot study we will complete in class, an analysis plan, a mock write-up for a conference submission, and a conference-length oral presentation.
