---

Recent research in cognitive science is shedding new light on the long-standing question of how people understand mathematics. This course will provide a review of this research. We will read papers investigating how adults, children, and non-human primates understand fundamental mathematical concepts such as number, arithmetic, and algebra. The papers will be drawn from the psychology, neuroscience, and education literatures.
