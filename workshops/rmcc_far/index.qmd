::: callout-note
I co-designed this course with Ethan Brown and we co-taught it 3 times over summer from 2019 to 2021.

FAR is a one-week online workshop designed to help participants learn how to tidy, visualize, and model data in R. This workshop is open to all: graduate students, postdocs, faculty, lecturers, and external researchers––and **no prior programming experience** is required or expected. By the end of this workshop, FAR students (along with other experienced R users) will be able to attend either of the Advanced workshops (AFAR Grouped and AFAR Latent).

Goals: Provide students with 1) an understanding of the **fundamental concepts** of scripting and programming using the R language 2) a set of **concrete skills** and **resources** for harnessing the power of R for tidying, visualizing, and modeling social science data. The emphasis will be on using R as a tool for analyzing and understanding data rather than on the details of statistical techniques.

Structure: This workshop is primarily organized around online activities, blending **asynchronous lessons** with daily **synchronous class discussion**. The workshop employs **active learning** techniques to get participants programming and solving problems as quickly as possible. During asynchronous portions, participants will work on **programming exercises**, while both instructors check student progress and provide assistance. The workshop is led by two instructors with extensive R and teaching experience and will be limited to only 50 students to ensure an active and **supportive** learning environment for all. Resources will be provided to participants to summarize what was covered during the day and provide tools for further study.
