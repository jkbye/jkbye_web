    "text": "Image credit: Meritt Thomas on Unsplash\nIn Part I of my series of posts on the Wason selection task, I detailed the development of the task (Wason, 1966), the discovery of the content effect (Wason & Shapiro, 1971), and early explanations for the effect and its failed replications (Griggs & Cox, 1982). We left off with the sentiment that reasoners must be using knowledge that is more abstract than specific memories but more concrete than context-free symbolic logic.\nNow we turn to the mid-‘80s, when two popular theories emerged to explain participants’ seemingly incompatible performance on different versions of the selection task: Cheng and Holyoak’s pragmatic reasoning schemas (1985, 1989; Cheng et al., 1986) and Cosmides and Tooby’s social contract theory (Cosmides, 1985; Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides & Tooby, 1992). The broader implications of these competing theories renewed interest among researchers in using the Wason selection task as a means for studying human deductive reasoning, and reflect a more general tension in cognitive science between thinking of the mind as a content-general information processor or a collection of content-specific modules."

    "section": "Pragmatic reasoning schemas",
    "text": "Pragmatic reasoning schemas\nIn the mid-1980s, cognitive psychologists Patricia Cheng and Keith Holyoak proposed a hypothesis that occupies a theoretical middle-ground between the purely semantic memory-cueing theories (Griggs & Cox, 1982; Manktelow & Evans, 1979) and the purely syntactic natural logic theories (Braine, 1978; Osherson, 1975; see Part I). Building off of cognitive psychology research on schematic knowledge and inference, their theory of pragmatic reasoning schemas (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, 1989; Cheng et al., 1986) claims that humans learn through experience the general structure of scenarios such as requiring permission to carry out a desired action. From this experience, reasoners are able to leverage the context-specific salience of the conditional’s contrapositive form (inferring “the desired action is not to be taken if the permission is not satisfied” from “if the action is to be taken, then the permission must be satisfied”) to bring to bear on relevant domains, even if they are novel. Thus, humans’ general reasoning skills allow for learning from examples and extrapolating to similarly structured situations.\nIn cognitive psychology, a schema (closely related to a script or frame) is a mental framework for representing patterns of information that are relatively constant across multiple instances of similar contexts. By consolidating specific memories of some like type into a single, more abstract representation, a schema leverages a large amount of explanatory and predictive weight for relatively little cognitive effort. Once you’ve learned a schema, you can use it to identify new instances of the schema and make reliable inferences from prior experiences.\nHumans frequently draw from schemas when encountering new examples of a familiar kind––we might assume that a graduate student’s office would contain books (Brewer & Treyens, 1981) or that a waitress in a restaurant would bring menus (Bower, Black, & Turner, 1979). Moreover, when learning new information, we draw on prior knowledge to make sensible inferences (Bransford & Franks, 1971).\nCheng and Holyoak’s account takes this notion of schema and applies it to social situations. They noted that most of the instances of facilitating contrapositive responses in the Wason selection task involved contexts with a broad theme in common––conditional rules describing scenarios of permission or obligation, which fall into the domain of deontic logic. These situations invariably consist of a goal (desired state or action) and a precondition (required state or action). A pragmatic reasoning schema contains sets of context-sensitive rules that are defined relative to an actor’s situational goal, and their relationship to the precondition for carrying out the goal.\nFor example, in the alcohol problem detailed in Part I, it’s easy to see that the fundamental logic of the drinking rule is that one is required to meet a precondition (being at least 21 years of age) in order to have permission to achieve the goal (consume alcohol). Cheng and Holyoak argue that if the problem context evokes a sense of permission, this cues the permission schema, and reasoners can tap into their general knowledge induced from prior personal experience with permission-based scenarios. In the drinking-rule case, the connection between the problem description and a sense of requiring permission seems relatively straightforward, which makes it very easy to draw on schematic knowledge of permissions."

    "title": "Psychology Classics: Wason Selection Task (Part II)",
    "section": "Production rules",
    "text": "Production rules\nBorrowing from the artificial intelligence terminology for frames (Minsky, 1975), Cheng and Holyoak propose a production system, which takes as arguments the contextual roles of a desired goal and a required precondition (rather than context-free logical symbols P and Q in a purely syntactic theory), as well as the modal concepts of possibility and necessity. When the antecedent of a production rule is satisfied, the consequent is instantiated. By matching isomorphic roles across different scenarios, reasoners can easily apply the schema’s production rules to make appropriate and useful inferences, even for novel situations (so long as the schema is properly cued).\nPermission Schema Production Rules (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 397):\n\nIf the action is to be taken, then the precondition must be satisfied.\nIf the action is not to be taken, then the precondition need not be satisfied.\nIf the precondition is satisfied, then the action may be taken.\nIf the precondition is not satisfied, then the action must not be taken.\n\nComparing these four production rules to the four logical arguments for the material conditional (see Part I), #1 is the original form of the conditional, #2 overrides the Denying the Antecedent fallacy, #3 overrides the Affirming the Consequent fallacy, and #4 is the contrapositive form of the conditional. Notice that all four rules contain modal verbs of necessity or possibility (“must”, “need”, “may”) and specify the roles of both action and precondition. This is the contextualized vocabulary of the permission schema.\nIn the alcohol example, it’s very easy to substitute “drinking alcohol” for the desired action and “at least 21 years old” as the precondition: “If someone is drinking alcohol, then they must be at least 21 years old.” For problems of permission and obligation (such as the alcohol problem), both the original and contrapositive forms (production rules #1 and #4, respectively) are relevant to the goal of detecting rule violations (anyone drinking alcohol must be 21, and anyone under 21 must not be drinking alcohol). Production rules #2 and #3 aid in avoiding common fallacies (so you don’t think that those not drinking alcohol must be under 21, or that 21-year-olds must be drinking alcohol). In the alcohol version of the Wason selection task (Problem 2 in Part I), rules #1 and #4 require us to turn over the cards with BEER and 19, respectively, whereas rules #2 and #3 allow us to ignore the cards with COKE and 35, respectively.\nWhile the contrapositive #4 is clearly useful in deontic contexts like alcohol regulations, Cheng and Holyoak (1985) point out that not all contrapositives are equally useful––just those which serve the goal of the reasoner, as is typically the case in a permission scenario. For example, the effortful (and clumsy) transposition of the non-deontic conditional “If I have a headache, then I should take some aspirin” to “If it’s not the case that I should take some aspirin, then I do not have a headache,” has essentially no utility. The reasoner’s goal is not to find out if she has a headache (presumably, she would either feel one or not), but rather to assess whether she should take some aspirin. Invoking modus tollens in this scenario is uninformative, which is why the vast majority of people have probably never thought to consider that contrapositive (besides logicians and cognitive psychologists, of course). So, whereas a permission schema would trigger the contrapositive production rule, this is not necessarily true of non-deontic conditionals (which is not to say that there are no non-deontic conditionals for which modus tollens has utility; see Almor & Sloman, 2000).\nIn the pragmatic reasoning schema framework, the reasoner must recognize that a situation matches their permission schema, align the situation with the schema, and execute any production rules relevant to their goal(s). It seems straightforward that this would account for subjects’ performance in the alcohol context, but at the same time most experimental subjects would have had direct experience with this rule. A better test for the theory would be to explain the results in support of the memory-cueing account (discussed in Part I) from experiments using the postage stamp rule, and to offer further evidence that is not explained by the memory-cueing account. Performance on the postage-rule task seemed dependent on whether the subjects had experience with the rule––the content effect (Johnson-Laird et al., 1972; Wason & Shapiro, 1971) was not apparent for younger British subjects (Golding, 1981) or American subjects who were unfamiliar with the rule (Griggs & Cox, 1982)."

    "section": "Experimental evidence",
    "text": "Experimental evidence\n\nExperiment 1\nCheng and Holyoak (1985, Experiment 1) tested subjects from both America and Hong Kong on two different versions of a Wason selection task rule: one a version of the postage stamp rule, and the other a new rule about cholera. They reasoned that the American subjects would not have much prior experience with either type of rule, but that the subjects from Hong Kong would have experience with the postage example, as a similar rule had recently been in place in Hong Kong. As an additional manipulation, they provided half of the subjects from each location with a rationale for the rules, whereas the other half received no rationale.\n\nProblem 3\nIn the postage stamp example (Problem 3), all subjects were told that they were to act as a postal clerk in a foreign country and enforce the rule: “If an envelope is sealed, then it must have a 20 cent stamp” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 399). Half of the subjects were then told that the rationale for the regulation was to increase profit from sealed, personal letters.\n\n\n\nWason Selection Task: Postage Example\n\n\nYou are shown these four cards and given the following prompt:\n“You are a postal clerk working in some foreign country. Part of your job is to go through letters to check the postage. The country’s postal regulation requires that if a letter is sealed, then it must carry a 20-cent stamp. In order to check that the regulation is followed, which of the following four envelopes would you turn over? Turn over only those that you need to check to be sure.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 400)\nRationale (given to half of subjects):\n“The rationale for this regulation is to increase profit from personal mail, which is nearly always sealed. Sealed letters are defined as personal and must therefore carry more postage than unsealed letters.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 400)\n\n\nProblem 4\nIn the cholera example (Problem 4), all subjects were told that they were to act as an immigration clerk in the Philippines and enforce the rule: “If a passenger’s form says ‘Entering’ on one side, then the other side must include ‘cholera’” (p. 399). Half of the subjects were told that the tropical diseases listed were passengers’ inoculations, and the rationale for the regulation was to ensure entering passengers were protected.\n\n\n\nWason Selection Task: Cholera Example\n\n\nYou are shown these four cards and given the following prompt:\n“You are an immigration officer at the International Airport in Manila, capital of the Philippines. Among the documents you have to check is a sheet called Form H. One side of this form indicates whether the passenger is entering the country or in transit, while the other side of the form lists names of tropical diseases. You have to make sure that if the form says ‘ENTERING’ on one side, then the other side includes cholera among the list of diseases. Which of the following forms would you have to turn over to check? Indicate only those that you need to check to be sure.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, pp. 400-401)\nRationale (given to half of subjects):\nThe other side of the form lists names of inoculations for tropical diseases that the passenger has had in the last 6 months. “This is to ensure that entering passengers are protected against the disease.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 401)\n\n\nExperiment 1 Results\nA purely syntactic (natural logic) theory would predict that all eight conditions (2 locations x 2 domains x 2 rationale) would yield similar results, and a purely semantic (memory-cueing) theory would predict that only Hong Kong subjects would do well on the postage rule (given their specific experience with a similar rule), and rationales would not make much difference in any condition. By contrast, Cheng and Holyoak predicted that only Hong Kong subjects given the postage rule would do well without a rationale, but that subjects in the other conditions (Hong Kong cholera, American postage, American cholera) would significantly improve when given a rationale.\n\n\n\nCheng & Holyoak (1985) Experiment 1 Results\n\n\nAs indicated in the figure, providing subjects with a regulation’s rationale improved correct responses from around 60% to around 90%, except for the Hong Kong subjects with the postage rule (who were already around 90% without the rationale). The syntactic natural-logic theory does not explain any differences between conditions (all shared the same if-then conditional logic rules), and the semantic memory-cueing theory does not readily explain the effect of the rationale (there were no experiential differences between subjects in the rationale and no-rationale conditions).\n\n\n\nExperiment 2\nThese results support the pragmatic reasoning schema theory, as subjects were able to reason normatively with unfamiliar rules if they were provided a rationale, which could have cued their permission schema. However, there are other possibilities, as the rationales did provide further content, which while not affecting subjects’ prior experience, may still have cued less directly related memories (at a more abstract level, reasoners are likely to have had experience with increasing profits or protecting against diseases, even if not these specific examples). Because this possibility still gives some credibility to the memory-cuing explanation of the content effect, Cheng and Holyoak (1985, Experiment 2) designed analogous materials that were considerably more abstract.\n\nProblem 5\nIn order to preserve the schema-cueing sense of permission, they kept the basic intro to the prompt used in Experiment 1, telling the reasoner that they were to act as an authority checking whether regulations are being followed. However, neither the actions nor their prerequisites were specified, and were represented purely as Action A and Precondition P. In this sense, the only content of the problem was the fact that this rule was a regulation (deontic), not just descriptive. In order to evoke a sense of permission, the conditional rule was framed as a requirement that people fulfill a precondition in order to carry out an action, and the reasoner was given the position of an authority enforcing the regulation.\n\n\n\nWason Selection Task: Abstract Permission Example\n\n\nYou are shown these four cards and given the following prompt:\n“Suppose you are an authority checking whether or not people are obeying certain regulations. The regulations all have the general form, ‘If one is to take action “A,” then one must first satisfy precondition “P.”’ In other words, in order to be permitted to do ‘A’, one must first have fulfilled prerequisite ‘P.’ The cards below contain information on four people: one side of the card indicates whether or not a person has taken action ‘A,’ the other indicates whether or not the same individual has fulfilled precondition ‘P.’ In order to check that a certain regulation is being followed, which of the cards below would you turn over? Turn over only those that you need to check to be sure.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 403)\n\n\nProblem 6\nIn a second condition, reasoners were given a scenario similar to the original Wason task, but formatted to match as closely as possible the abstract regulation problem above. (Cheng and Holyoak note that while the original Wason task is often called ‘abstract’, the entities––letters and numbers––do have concreteness to them; it is the arbitrary nature of the rule that really matters, in contrast to the non-arbitrary practical implications of a regulation.) Subjects were told that they were to determine whether a rule (“If a card has an ‘A’ on one side, then it must have a ‘4’ on the other side”) was being followed. To more closely match the abstract permission problem, cards that negated the ‘A’ or ‘4’ were explicitly labeled as such (e.g., ‘7’ was captioned ‘i.e., not 4’ and ‘B’ ‘i.e., not A’) and the modal must was included in the rule. Importantly, while logically identical to the abstract permission problem, the conditional in this problem was not phrased as a regulation, but rather as a descriptive rule.\n\n\n\nWason Selection Task: Abstract Arbitrary Example\n\n\nYou are shown these four cards and given the following prompt:\n“Below are four cards. Every card has a letter on one side and a number on the other. Your task is to decide which of the cards you need to turn over in order to find out whether or not a certain rule is being followed. The rule is: ‘If a card has an “A” on one side, then it must have a “4” on the other side.’ Turn over only those cards that you need to check to be sure.” (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985, p. 403)\n\n\nExperiment 2 Results\nComparing the abstract permission problem to the arbitrary card problem, subjects did remarkably better with the abstract (61% correct vs. 19% correct). This dramatic result suggests that it is not the concreteness of the terms (which could cue semantic memory) but the context of permission that elicits modus tollens responses. Whereas the results from Experiment 1 could still be explained by the memory-cueing theory, Experiment 2 cannot be easily explained. While pragmatic reasoning schemas are also experience-dependent, the inferences from production rules can be content-independent if the problem structure matches the learned schema. In this sense, Cheng and Holyoak’s theory blends the best features of both semantic and syntactic theories, and explains the experimental evidence well."

    "text": "Conclusion\nCheng and Holyoak’s (1985) results provide evidence against the natural-logic and memory-cueing theories, and their theory of pragmatic reasoning schemas offers a parsimonious explanation of the data. While it is not the only way to explain performance on the Wason selection task, their theory intuitively balances the roles of experience and logic. Moreover, their insight reinvigorated interest in the Wason selection task as a paradigm for studying human reasoning.\n\nDisclosure of professional connection to featured research\nThe author, Jeffrey K.

    "text": "Image credit: Marius Masalar on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog post was originally published on the Psychology in Action blog in September 2011.\n\n\nOne of the most fascinating and quickly growing subareas of psychology and the cognitive sciences is music cognition, the interdisciplinary study of how the brain processes and perceives music. Music cognition is driven primarily by the perception of tempo and pitch, as well as the important concept of expectation.\nTempo, the speed or pace of a musical composition, can be thought of as the backbone of music cognition. But tempo is not unique to music––it is deeply rooted in biological mechanisms of time-keeping such as your heartbeat or sleep cycle. A widely distributed network of neurons in the brain are involved in processing the tempo of music, but the cerebellum plays perhaps the most crucial role in keeping time.\nOur brains are wired to keep a beat––studies have shown that in both musicians and non-musicians, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 are the easiest beats to keep. We not only have a knack for keeping tempo, we have a surprising amount of memory for it as well. A recent study showed that a majority of non-musicians could sing popular songs off the top of their head within 4 percent of the recording’s actual tempo!\nTempo has universal qualities found all across the world. For example, every known musical system has patterns of strong and weak beats. These accents of the tempo work to establish a natural pulse-like pattern. Tempo is also of critical importance in dance. In fact, in many cultures around the world, music and dance are seen as the same activity, and no line is drawn between performers and spectators.\nAnother essential property of music is pitch: the musical note we perceive from certain sound frequencies. One of the most astounding findings of research into music and sound is that pitch is an entirely psychological phenomenon determined from frequencies. This is not unprecedented in the science of perception, as we’ve known since the days of Newton that color works in much the same way.\nIn nearly all musical cultures around the world, pitches are organized into octaves of five to seven discrete notes. Structuring pitches into octaves helps distinguish two separate but related aspects of a note’s frequency: relative pitch, which determines the musical note we hear (e.g., 220 and 440 Hz have the same relative pitch: A), and absolute pitch, which determines how high or low any given note sounds (e.g., 440 Hz is a higher-pitched A than 220 Hz). Octaves are so important to music cognition that Paul Cooper called them the “basic miracle of music”.\nOne of the most remarkable things about note frequencies is that unlike most all of perception, they have direct correlates in the brain: if someone listens to a pure 440 Hz tone, there are neurons in their auditory cortex that will fire at exactly that rate. When harmonic instruments are played, each note is accompanied by integer multiples of that frequency (overtones), which are also mirrored in neuron’s firing rates. Brains are so good at detecting pitch that they are capable of restoring a missing fundamental note (reconstructing the base frequency from just the overtones).\nIt is clear that we are biologically disposed to music, but there is much about music cognition that is determined by experience. As we are exposed to our culture’s music in childhood, we become accustomed to musical scales that are native to that music. An experiment showed that 6-month-olds are equally good at detecting a mistuning in their native scales as their non-native scales; by adulthood, this ability is fine-tuned only to native scales (a similar fine-tuning is exhibited as infants learn the phonology of their native language). Studies have shown that by the age of five, most children have learned the rules of ‘legal’ chord progressions in their culture’s music.\nThese learned ‘rules’ explain how even non-musicians can tell when a note is out of place. The cringing caused by the dissonance of an off note reveals just how critical expectation is to music cognition. When our expectation is violated, we feel tension. One particular example of this is seen in a phenomenon called “gap fill”––when a melody makes a large leap up or down octaves, we anticipate that the next note will change direction, to counteract the tension caused by moving away from the tonic. This is one of many expectations about pitch that can be exploited by musicians to create novel auditory experiences.\nLanguage, in contrast music, is not organized by pitch. In natural speaking, there is no rule to the pitch of syllables, so we don’t feel that tension. But fascinating research by Diana Deutsch has shown that if you take a recording of speech that sounds completely nonmusical and loop it, you will begin perceive a melody. The repetition creates structure, and once you’ve heard it looped you will find it difficult to ignore the melody even months later.\nBut if music were just rules and repetition, it’d be boring and we would have run out of songs by now. Some of the most brilliant pieces of music deliberately flout your expectations, such as John Philip Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever” and Joseph Haydn’s aptly named “Surprise Symphony”. Consistent with modern and contemporary art movements, 20th century music strove to surprise listeners in more unique ways, including the improvisational techniques explored by jazz greats like Ornette Coleman, the aleatoric randomness pioneered by John Cage, and atonal music by modern masters like Stravinsky and Prokofiev. Moreover, music’s timbre (the sound quality or character that differentiates a saxophone’s middle C from a trumpet’s middle C) is another critical component to the musical experience that we haven’t the space to discuss.\nAll in all, music cognition is a fascinating field and there is much still to be learned. For further reading, I highly suggest Daniel Levitin’s very approachable book, This is Your Brain on Music, or Oliver Sacks’ Musicophilia. For your audio enjoyment, check out Diana Deutch’s CD, Phantom Words, And Other Curiosities.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{bye2011,\n  author = {Bye, Jeffrey},\n  title = {Music {Cognition}},\n  date = {2011-09-02},\n  url = {https://www.psychologyinaction.org/2011-09-02-music-cognition/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBye, Jeffrey. 2011. “Music Cognition.” Psychology In\nAction (blog).

The emphasis will be on using R as a tool for analyzing and understanding data rather than on the details of statistical techniques.\nStructure: This workshop is primarily organized around online activities, blending asynchronous lessons with daily synchronous class discussion. The workshop employs active learning techniques to get participants programming and solving problems as quickly as possible. During asynchronous portions, participants will work on programming exercises, while both instructors check student progress and provide assistance. The workshop is led by two instructors with extensive R and teaching experience and will be limited to only 50 students to ensure an active and supportive learning environment for all. Resources will be provided to participants to summarize what was covered during the day and provide tools for further study."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Jeffrey Hamilton on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog post was originally published on the Psychology in Action blog in January 2011, and later republished on Psychology Today in May 2011.\n\n\nOver the last couple of decades, learning and memory researchers have become increasingly interested in bringing scientific findings out of the lab and into the classroom, where they can be implemented into teaching methods to produce more efficient and effective learning. In a nation mired in an educational crisis, there’s never been a better time or place to bridge the gap between modern scientific knowledge and outdated teaching techniques. One of the greatest insights in the last 20 years that has serious potential to improve classroom teaching has been Robert Bjork’s concept of desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994; McDaniel & Butler, in press), which suggests that introducing certain difficulties into the learning process can greatly improve long-term retention of the learned material. In psychology studies thus far, these difficulties have generally been modifications to commonly used methods that add some sort of additional hurdle during the learning or studying process. Some notable examples:\n\nSpacing learning sessions apart rather than massing them together (Baddeley & Longman, 1978; Dempster, 1990)\nTesting learners on material rather than having them simply restudy it (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)\nHaving learners generate target material through a puzzle or other kind of active process, rather than simply reading it passively (McDaniel et al., 1994)\nVarying the settings in which learning takes place (Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978)\nMaking material less clearly organized for learners with some background knowledge (McNamara et al., 1996)\nUsing fonts that are slightly harder to read (Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, & Vaughan, in press)\n\nWhat all of these difficulties have in common is that they seem to encourage a deeper processing of material than people would normally engage in without explicit instruction to do so. It’s understandable why students would want learning to be easier, and why teachers would want to make it easier. If an instructor tries a few different approaches to teaching some concept or material, she would likely conclude that the approach which leads to the most immediate and observable signs of student improvement is the best one. In fact, when teachers try to facilitate learning by making it as easy as possible, this may increase the immediately observable short-term performance, but it decreases the more important long-term retention. In short, we often seek to eliminate difficulties in learning, to our own detriment.\nTo appreciate why difficulties might actually be desirable, it helps to first understand the distinction between performance, which is observable during learning and testing, and the actual learning itself, which is a long-term process that is difficult to measure. Consider the somewhat simplified example of a history student memorizing a list of important events and the dates they happened. In psychology lingo, we’d say she learns an association between a cue (the event) and a response (the date). The student might notice a rapid increase in her performance as dates are recalled more frequently and confidently over the course of a particular studying session. But if she only studies the list once, a few days later she will probably remember just a fraction of these dates, even if she had been performing perfectly by the end of her studying. The increased accessibility of the dates at the end of a learning session is akin to the idea that something is “fresh on your mind.” So if we watch the student reach perfect recall, we are observing her increased performance, but her rapid improvement does not ensure that the information will be accessible in the long term. Because the dates are “fresh”, her effortless recall at the end is misleading, as the freshness will fade quickly without further study or review; the dates, though easily relearned, will fall below the threshold of accessibility.\nIn their “New Theory of Disuse” (NTD) framework, Bjork and Bjork (1992) convincingly argue for a theoretical distinction between retrieval strength, the immediate accessibility of some knowledge at any given moment, and storage strength, the measure of how many times that knowledge has been accessed over the long term. Storage strength is theoretically infinite (we can learn as much as we want about as many things as we want), but it does not directly influence our performance; our ability to access a particular stored memory at some point in time is entirely determined by its current retrieval strength. Unlike storage strength, which can only increase over time, retrieval strength fades, and when storage strength is low (such as in newly learned information), it fades even more quickly.\nApplying the NTD framework to the example above, the retrieval strength for each date is increased dramatically throughout the session until it reaches a ceiling around perfect recall; the storage strength, however, is only gradually increased, and because it is low overall (the dates have only recently been learned) retrieval strength will fall quickly with disuse. Thus, the heightened performance at the end of a training session is due to higher retrieval strength, but this does not translate to long-term retention, which is determined by the relationship between storage and retrieval strengths (for a more complete explanation of the complex interactions between storage and retrieval strengths, see Bjork & Bjork, 1992). Making learning too easy and straightforward can cause a misleading boost in the retrieval strength without causing the deeper processing that encourages the long-term retention afforded by higher storage strength.\nThe biggest obstacle in implementing desirable difficulties into classroom curricula is likely to be convincing teachers and students alike that these difficulties are indeed desirable. When learning is difficult, people make more errors, and they infer from this that their method is ineffective. In the short term, difficulties inhibit performance, causing more errors and more apparent forgetting. But it is this forgetting that actually benefits the learner in the long term; relearning forgotten material takes demonstrably less time with each iteration. These “savings” that arise from forgetting and relearning in spaced trials were first documented over 120 years ago (Ebbinghaus, 1885/1964), and yet they still are not well utilized in education or understood by the general public. This is likely because long-term benefits are less noticeable. The spacing effect, for example, is a robust finding across many areas of learning, and yet most people believe massed practice is more effective (Bjork, 1994). In reality, there are short-term benefits to massing (cramming for a test the night before can help you pass the test), but the fact that spacing greatly improves long-term retention is less obvious.\nEducation is supposed to be about teaching knowledge and skills that students will use throughout their lives. So it should go without saying that teachers should utilize methods that facilitate long-term retention, especially when those methods are easy to implement. As discussed by Yalda T. Uhls, our shorter school year doesn’t explain America’s low scores on PISA tests. We have to focus less on how much we teach and more on how we teach, and how we can improve it.\nEducation reformers should keep in mind that teachers and administrators may be improving short-term performance when they design curricula to be as easy as possible, but they may also be hurting long-term learning. As our scientific understanding of the dynamics of desirable difficulties improves, so should our implementation of these practices into our educational system. While we need further research into desirable difficulties, we also greatly need dialogue between scientists and teachers to help improve learning in the classroom.\nCitations:\n\nBaddeley, A.D., & Longman, D.J.A.

    "text": "Image credit: Michael Dziedzic on Unsplash\nIn the 1960s, Peter Cathcart Wason introduced a test of logical reasoning that he termed the selection task (1966, 1968, 1969a, 1969b). Almost fifty years later, the Wason selection task is still a source of much research and debate, albeit not quite in the way he had originally intended. Introduced as a test of his theory of confirmation bias, Wason’s task has ended up a widely used experimental paradigm for examining human reasoning in the domains of abstract logic, social conduct, and various other semantic contexts. The task has become contentious in cognitive science research, but it is still commonly studied today due to the fact that people’s performance demonstrates a striking content effect, although the psychological account of when and how this phenomenon occurs has been continually revised over the last few decades. Before going any further, let’s try Wason’s original version (1966):\nProblem 1\nYou are shown these four green cards and given the following prompt:\nYou are told these four cards have a letter on one side and a number on the other. You are given a rule about the four cards: If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other side.\nYou are asked, which card(s) do you need to turn over in order to determine if the rule is true or false?\nThe shocking thing about Wason’s results is that the logically correct (normative) answer is only chosen by about 4% of subjects (Wason & Shapiro, 1971). Although subjects clearly recognize the importance of selecting the A card, it is logical to select the 7 card as well, because in the event that it has a vowel on the other side, the rule would be violated (thus falsified). Conversely, there is no logical reason to select the 4 card because it is not possible for it to falsify the rule––whether there is a vowel or a consonant on the other side is irrelevant as there is no restriction on an even-consonant pair."

    "section": "A bit of logic",
    "text": "A bit of logic\nIn order to more precisely characterize subjects’ logical reasoning, it’s worthwhile to summarize a few bits of formal logic. First, the logical structure intended in Wason selection tasks is a simple conditional––that is, an “if P then Q” statement. When it comes to the logical form of a conditional, P → Q, we call proposition P the antecedent and proposition Q the consequent (the thing that follows from the antecedent). We can either affirm (state as true) or deny (state as false) either of the propositions, thus there are four simple argument structures that could be applied. Two of these arguments are logically valid (their conclusion will always be true if their premises are true), and the other two are logically invalid (their conclusion can be false even if their premises are true).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffirming the Antecedent (modus ponens)\n1. P → Q\n2. P              \nTherefore, Q\n\nDenying the Antecedent (INVALID)\n1. P → Q\n2. ~P              \nTherefore, ~Q\n\n\n\nAffirming the Consequent (INVALID)\n1. P → Q\n2. Q              \nTherefore, P\n\nDenying the Consequent (modus tollens)\n1. P → Q\n2. ~Q              \nTherefore, ~P\n\n\n\nTable 1: Valid and Invalid Arguments for Conditional Logic\nTable 1 shows the four simple arguments for P → Q, with their conclusions below the lines. The more obvious of the valid arguments is Affirming the Antecedent, which is called modus ponens. Clearly, if the premise P → Q is true, and we know P is true, then it follows that Q is true. The much trickier valid argument, which is most relevant to the effects we see in the Wason selection task, is Denying the Consequent (modus tollens). If we know that Q follows from P, but we know Q is false, then working backwards, P must also be false (or else Q would have been true). The validity of this argument becomes more apparent when we (validly) rearrange the conditional into its contrapositive form: ~Q → ~P, at which point we can use modus ponens to conclude ~P from ~Q (where ~X is read “not X”).\nWason’s subjects overwhelmingly failed to apply modus tollens, an important method of falsification. In order to fully assess whether the rule is true or false, one must look for the presence of P when there is an absence of Q, because the contrapositive requires there be no P if there is no Q. A simpler way to put this is that the only possible way to falsify the rule is to find a card with P on one side and ~Q on the other side; thus, only cards showing a P or ~Q are worth checking."

    "section": "The content effect",
    "text": "The content effect\nIn 1971, Wason and his doctoral student, Diana Shapiro, published a study demonstrating that participants still struggled with the abstract form of the task (even after being given a practice abstract problem to learn from). However, they were much more likely to give the modus tollens (~Q) response on an isomorphic thematic (semantic) version of the task. Subjects evaluated the rule “Every time I go to Manchester I travel by car,” using cards with cities on one side and modes of transport on the other. The explanation for the improved performance was that while the British participants wouldn’t have experience reasoning about relations between even numbers and vowels, they would have experience with traveling by car or train to cities in the UK, which facilitated their reasoning.\nBecause the two problems were written such that underlying logical structure was (presumably) equivalent across conditions, Wason and Shapiro (1971) argued that the improved performance on the thematic version was evidence of a semantic, not syntactic, effect. However, this in and of itself was not all that surprising––they acknowledged that the increased salience of ‘concrete’ terms, in line with prior research, might make them easier to symbolically manipulate and reason about. In a similar thematic experiment, Wason’s former student, Philip Johnson-Laird, along with Italian psychologists Paolo and Maria Legrenzi, (1972) tested British subjects on a form of the selection task using a rule about the value of postage stamps necessary to send a letter in a closed or open envelope (there was a lower postage rate for unsealed mail). Again, researchers believed that familiarity with the problem context helped them identify and reason normatively about the underlying logical structure, thus increasing the modus tollens responses.\nOver the next decade came a series of seemingly contradictory results, such as Griggs and Cox’s (1982) failure to replicate Wason and Shapiro’s (1971) and Johnson-Laird et al.’s (1972) results using the same problem contexts (travel and postage) with American subjects. Golding (1981) used a similar postage rule that had actually been used in Britain (but had since been abandoned) and showed facilitation in older British subjects (who would have had experience with the old rule), but not younger subjects. Taken altogether, these results indicated an important role of prior experience with the content of a rule, especially instances of counterexamples (P & ~Q), leading some researchers to posit that reasoners typically don’t use general rules of inference, but rather draw from domain-specific memories of relevant counterexamples (Griggs & Cox, 1982; Manktelow & Evans, 1979). This so-called “memory-cueing” hypothesis stated that rather than facilitating the normative logical structure, domain-specific familiarity merely allowed participants to access their memory of counterexamples, obviating the need for domain-general logic.\nHere is a classic example of a concrete Wason selection task with a rule most Americans should be familiar with (adapted from Griggs & Cox, 1982):\nProblem 2\nYou are shown these four orange cards and given the following prompt:\n\n\n\nWason Selection Task: Thematic\n\n\nYou are told these four cards represent patrons in a bar, and each card has their drink on one side and their age in years on the other. You are given a rule about the four patrons: If a patron is drinking a beer, then they must be 21 years or older.\nYou are asked, which card(s) do you need to turn over in order to determine if the rule is being followed?\n\n\nClick here to show typical results for this experiment.\n\n\nThis permission-schema (alcohol) form of the Wason selection task generally yields the following distribution of answers (Griggs & Cox, 1982, Exp. 3):\n\n~ 0% pick the BEER card and the 35 card\n~ 20% pick the BEER card alone\n~ 3% pick the BEER card, 35 card, and the 19 card\n~ 72% pick the BEER card and the 19 card [correct]\n~ 5% pick other combinations of cards\n\n\n\n\nIt seems unsurprising that people would understand that in this bar context, one would need to check a 19-year-old to make sure they weren’t drinking. It’s likely that subjects are familiar with the concept of alcohol laws and underaged drinking, and would readily recognize that a 19-year-old could potentially violate the rule whereas a 35-year-old could not. This is an instance in which subjects readily reason by modus tollens, because the contrapositive of the rule (“If you are NOT 21 years or older, then you must NOT be drinking beer”) seems much more obvious than the contrapositive in the abstract case (and certain other thematic domains). One reason for this difference is that subjects would not have personal experience with, for example, the abstract vowel-even number context from Problem 1, such that subjects would not be able to pull up a relevant memory to arrive at the normatively logical solution.\nBut the memory-cueing theory would not last long, because it was soon found that performance could be facilitated in contexts for which most people would not have had specific experience (e.g., a certain system of monitoring sales receipts in a department store; D’Andrade, 1982). Reasoners seem to be able to draw on some sort of more general knowledge––more abstract than specific memories but less abstract than formal logic.\nIn the next post on the Wason selection task, I will discuss the a popular theory that emerged in the 1980s and generated a new wave of interest in research with the task. Stay tuned for more!\nUpdate: Part II"

    "title": "Desirable Difficulties in Math Teaching",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog post was originally published on the Psychology in Action blog in February 2011.\n\n\nContinuing in the spirit of my last post, which overviewed the desirable difficulties literature, and Carole Yue’s recent post on how desirable difficulties can improve induction tasks, today I’m highlighting some recent research on applying such difficulties to math learning and practice. As a quick recap, desirable difficulties are adjustments to teaching that slow down learning in the short term, but improve long-term retention. In other words, making learning harder can actually make it more effective. Two of the most robust desirable difficulties are spacing (the distribution of practice sessions over time as opposed to massing them together) and interleaving (alternating practice on different types of problems, like ABCABC, as opposed to blocking them, like AABBCC). Recently, psychologists have begun expanding research on these techniques to conceptual subjects like math.\n\nEvidence for Benefits of Spacing and Interleaving Math Problems\nIn a series of experiments (Rohrer & Taylor, 2006; Rohrer & Taylor, 2007; Taylor, 2008; Rohrer, 2009; Taylor & Rohrer, 2010), Rohrer and Taylor have consistently demonstrated that interleaving and spacing both benefit later performance on math problems. For example, Rohrer and Taylor (2006) instructed subjects on how to solve permutations with repeating elements. Half of the subjects (massers) did 10 practice problems in one session while the other half (spacers) had two different 5 problem sessions. Subjects were tested either 1 or 4 weeks after their final practice session. For those who were tested after 1 week, there was no significant difference between massers and spacers, but after 4 weeks the spacers did much better than the massers. In another experiment (2007), subjects were taught how to find the volume of four different obscure geometric figures. The practice problems were either blocked by type (one figure at a time) or interleaved; each group had two practice sessions a week apart, and then were tested one week after the second practice. They found that during the first practice session, the interleavers performed much worse, while during the second session, the disparity narrowed but blockers still did better. Critically, after being tested at a one week delay, interleavers drastically outperformed blockers (63% to 20%).\nA recent study by Rickard, Lau, & Pashler (2008) utilized spacing and interleaving in an interesting way. Their experiment made use of a unique aspect of mathematics: there are two ways to solving problems––by calculation (process) or by direct retrieval of the answer (memory). For instance, if you have your multiplication tables memorized, you would use direct retrieval (upon seeing 6 x 4, 24 “pops” into your head). But if you couldn’t freely recall the answer, you would use the procedures of multiplication to calculate it. In this sense, repeating the same math problem leads not only to more correct responses, but to faster response times (RTs), because memory is quicker than calculation. In Rickard et al.’s experiment, subjects studied 24 different multi-digit multiplication problems, each of which they repeated 15 times. Some subjects were given the problems in 8 blocks of 3 (repeating 3 different problems 15 times each before moving to the next block of 3), and the other half completed the problems in 2 blocks of 12. The subjects who had larger set sizes (12) made more errors and had longer RTs during the training session, but they outperformed the smaller set size (3) group on a test given after a delay. This suggests that training on small problem sizes allows people to rely on direct retrieval early on (it’s easier to remember 3 things at a time than 12), and they don’t get the full benefit from calculating answers multiple times. Indeed, in a follow-up, they found that while subjects with small set sizes relied much more on direct retrieval during training, those with larger set sizes were actually able to use more direct retrieval after a 2-day delay. This helps illustrate why it is that practicing material that is “fresh on your mind” provides minimal benefits: the immediate accessibility of an answer means that further practice isn’t engaging any actual conceptual/computational processes.\n\n\nImplementing Desirable Difficulties into Math Curricula\nSo what do these results mean for practical changes to math education? The demonstrated benefits of spacing and interleaving greatly challenge the typical format of math lesson plans and textbooks, which typically structure homework assignments around repeatedly practicing a recently learned skill or problem type. By massing the same kinds of problems together, students’ performance within a single class or homework assignment might improve, but it won’t benefit their long-term retention of those skills. Rohrer and Taylor (2007) have argued that textbooks with a shuffled format (interleaved/spaced practice) are better than the standard format of most math textbooks. A shuffled format, they suggest, would be structured such that “after a lesson on the quadratic formula, the immediately following practice set would include no more than a few quadratic formula problems, with other quadratic formula problems appearing in subsequent practice sets with decreasing frequency” (2007, p. 482). This would ensure that practice problems within a set would be a mixture of previous problem types, and practice for a given topic would be spaced throughout the textbook. The beginning of a textbook could interleave topics covered in previous years. Rohrer and Taylor mention that a well known example of a shuffled format textbook is the Saxon series. I perused a sample of their Algebra 1 textbook online, and I’m very impressed with their use of interleaving.\nAs a former math tutor, one of the most common problems I’ve encountered is that students might actually know the formulas for finding, say, the volume of common 3-dimensional shapes, but they sometimes struggle with remembering which formula applies to which shape––and that’s exactly what they need to do on a test. This is likely because they don’t do enough mixed practice, which necessarily involves remembering which formula to apply for each problem. Yet think about a typical textbook chapter or classroom lesson plan on volume. The students might first learn the simplest example: rectangular prisms. After a 20-problem worksheet on rectangular prisms, they might move onto other prisms, then cylinders, then pyramids, cones, and finally spheres. At each step, problem sets involve primarily the shapes just learned. In all of the geometry textbooks I’ve seen, this has been the case. Some textbooks have periodic mixed reviews, but that’s an exception, not the rule. If textbooks interleaved problems systematically, students would always need to decide which formula or type of computation to use for the problem.\nOne important consideration is that the standard format that most textbooks utilize might be so common because as teachers we like to have material organized into modular lesson plans. It might be convenient for us, and students might prefer it because topics are more delineated; they also might notice their performance improving through a 20-problem set. However, we have to be aware that after the first few practice problems, each additional problem may provide very little benefit (a sort of law of diminishing returns). In contrast, if we restructured lesson plans and textbooks to utilize more desirable difficulties like spacing and interleaving, students might actually learn better and remember things longer. Perhaps the best news is that shuffling problems is cost-effective, and wouldn’t necessitate rewriting the whole textbook. Authors would merely have to take their existing problems and interleave them throughout the book in an appropriate manner.\nBecause this research is still new, most of these studies have only been carried out in the laboratory with college students. To fully assess the practical benefits of spacing and interleaving, subsequent research should analyze how these desirable difficulties affect actual learning in practice. Importantly, scientists and teachers need to work together to test these hypotheses in the classroom. Hopefully, with more research like this and open dialogue between scientists, teachers, and textbook writers, we can restructure math teaching to improve learning.\n\n\nCitations\n\nRickard, T.C., Lau, J.S., & Pashler, H.

It also serves as a gateway to the Cognitive Science Major in the Department of Psychology at UCLA. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary study of the mind, encompassing research from psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, and artificial intelligence. Because we cannot cover everything I’d like to in just six weeks, we will aim to provide a reasonably deep introduction to several of the key topics and research approaches. In this course, we will emphasize the philosophical foundations of cognitive science, computational models of cognition, and substantive areas such as thinking, reasoning, and language. There are many additional topics I would love to include but have skipped them because they are covered well in other courses (especially Psych 120A: Cognitive Psychology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInterested in this course?

In the first part of the course, we’ll review published experiments and then work together to design our own experiments in various areas of cognitive psychology, including perception, memory, decision making, and reasoning. We’ll be discussing the basics of signal detection theory, psychophysics, response time measures, and instruction manipulations. As we try to design our own experiments, we’ll be confronted with many difficulties and confounds that will require clever experimental design to overcome. In order to help think of solutions, we will be looking very closely at the methods sections of a number of research papers for inspiration (and to learn from their mistakes!). In the second part of the course, you will be using the experimental tools you learned about to design and implement your own experiments in teams. You may pursue any research question in any subfield of cognitive psychology. In the final part of the course, you will analyze your data, write up the results of your experiment in a formal paper, and make an oral presentation of your findings."

    "text": "This course introduces MATLAB and programming methods in a general way, but with a special eye toward application in experimental psychology research and data analysis. The course assumes no previous programming experience, and students will learn to read and write code for creating programs, analyzing data, and modeling.\nComputer science is an important facet of cognitive science: we write programs to perform statistics and data analysis, to do computational modeling, to create stimuli and to conduct experiments. There are very few aspects of research as conducted today that do not require some knowledge of programming. MATLAB is often the programming language of choice for many branches of psychology, especially with the availability of numerous free and specialized toolboxes (e.g. psychophysics toolbox). This course is the first part of a two-part series that is designed as a practical application of computer science and programming to psychological research. Students will learn many programming basics that can be transferred to other languages (e.g., Python and R, also commonly used in psychology), they will learn to perform statistical and advanced analyses of data sets, and how to create complex computer programs and simulations. This course serves as an introduction to Psych 20B which will focus on applying these techniques to the creation of psychology experiments."
