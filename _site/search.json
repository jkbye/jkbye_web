    "title": "Desirable Difficulties in the Classroom",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Jeffrey Hamilton on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog post was originally published on the Psychology in Action blog in January 2011, and later republished on Psychology Today in May 2011.\n\n\nOver the last couple of decades, learning and memory researchers have become increasingly interested in bringing scientific findings out of the lab and into the classroom, where they can be implemented into teaching methods to produce more efficient and effective learning. In a nation mired in an educational crisis, there’s never been a better time or place to bridge the gap between modern scientific knowledge and outdated teaching techniques. One of the greatest insights in the last 20 years that has serious potential to improve classroom teaching has been Robert Bjork’s concept of desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994; McDaniel & Butler, in press), which suggests that introducing certain difficulties into the learning process can greatly improve long-term retention of the learned material. In psychology studies thus far, these difficulties have generally been modifications to commonly used methods that add some sort of additional hurdle during the learning or studying process. Some notable examples:\n\nSpacing learning sessions apart rather than massing them together (Baddeley & Longman, 1978; Dempster, 1990)\nTesting learners on material rather than having them simply restudy it (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)\nHaving learners generate target material through a puzzle or other kind of active process, rather than simply reading it passively (McDaniel et al., 1994)\nVarying the settings in which learning takes place (Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978)\nMaking material less clearly organized for learners with some background knowledge (McNamara et al., 1996)\nUsing fonts that are slightly harder to read (Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, & Vaughan, in press)\n\nWhat all of these difficulties have in common is that they seem to encourage a deeper processing of material than people would normally engage in without explicit instruction to do so. It’s understandable why students would want learning to be easier, and why teachers would want to make it easier. If an instructor tries a few different approaches to teaching some concept or material, she would likely conclude that the approach which leads to the most immediate and observable signs of student improvement is the best one. In fact, when teachers try to facilitate learning by making it as easy as possible, this may increase the immediately observable short-term performance, but it decreases the more important long-term retention. In short, we often seek to eliminate difficulties in learning, to our own detriment.\nTo appreciate why difficulties might actually be desirable, it helps to first understand the distinction between performance, which is observable during learning and testing, and the actual learning itself, which is a long-term process that is difficult to measure. Consider the somewhat simplified example of a history student memorizing a list of important events and the dates they happened. In psychology lingo, we’d say she learns an association between a cue (the event) and a response (the date). The student might notice a rapid increase in her performance as dates are recalled more frequently and confidently over the course of a particular studying session. But if she only studies the list once, a few days later she will probably remember just a fraction of these dates, even if she had been performing perfectly by the end of her studying. The increased accessibility of the dates at the end of a learning session is akin to the idea that something is “fresh on your mind.” So if we watch the student reach perfect recall, we are observing her increased performance, but her rapid improvement does not ensure that the information will be accessible in the long term. Because the dates are “fresh”, her effortless recall at the end is misleading, as the freshness will fade quickly without further study or review; the dates, though easily relearned, will fall below the threshold of accessibility.\nIn their “New Theory of Disuse” (NTD) framework, Bjork and Bjork (1992) convincingly argue for a theoretical distinction between retrieval strength, the immediate accessibility of some knowledge at any given moment, and storage strength, the measure of how many times that knowledge has been accessed over the long term. Storage strength is theoretically infinite (we can learn as much as we want about as many things as we want), but it does not directly influence our performance; our ability to access a particular stored memory at some point in time is entirely determined by its current retrieval strength. Unlike storage strength, which can only increase over time, retrieval strength fades, and when storage strength is low (such as in newly learned information), it fades even more quickly.\nApplying the NTD framework to the example above, the retrieval strength for each date is increased dramatically throughout the session until it reaches a ceiling around perfect recall; the storage strength, however, is only gradually increased, and because it is low overall (the dates have only recently been learned) retrieval strength will fall quickly with disuse. Thus, the heightened performance at the end of a training session is due to higher retrieval strength, but this does not translate to long-term retention, which is determined by the relationship between storage and retrieval strengths (for a more complete explanation of the complex interactions between storage and retrieval strengths, see Bjork & Bjork, 1992). Making learning too easy and straightforward can cause a misleading boost in the retrieval strength without causing the deeper processing that encourages the long-term retention afforded by higher storage strength.\nThe biggest obstacle in implementing desirable difficulties into classroom curricula is likely to be convincing teachers and students alike that these difficulties are indeed desirable. When learning is difficult, people make more errors, and they infer from this that their method is ineffective. In the short term, difficulties inhibit performance, causing more errors and more apparent forgetting. But it is this forgetting that actually benefits the learner in the long term; relearning forgotten material takes demonstrably less time with each iteration. These “savings” that arise from forgetting and relearning in spaced trials were first documented over 120 years ago (Ebbinghaus, 1885/1964), and yet they still are not well utilized in education or understood by the general public. This is likely because long-term benefits are less noticeable. The spacing effect, for example, is a robust finding across many areas of learning, and yet most people believe massed practice is more effective (Bjork, 1994). In reality, there are short-term benefits to massing (cramming for a test the night before can help you pass the test), but the fact that spacing greatly improves long-term retention is less obvious.\nEducation is supposed to be about teaching knowledge and skills that students will use throughout their lives. So it should go without saying that teachers should utilize methods that facilitate long-term retention, especially when those methods are easy to implement. As discussed by Yalda T. Uhls, our shorter school year doesn’t explain America’s low scores on PISA tests. We have to focus less on how much we teach and more on how we teach, and how we can improve it.\nEducation reformers should keep in mind that teachers and administrators may be improving short-term performance when they design curricula to be as easy as possible, but they may also be hurting long-term learning. As our scientific understanding of the dynamics of desirable difficulties improves, so should our implementation of these practices into our educational system. While we need further research into desirable difficulties, we also greatly need dialogue between scientists and teachers to help improve learning in the classroom.\nCitations:\n\nBaddeley, A.D., & Longman, D.J.A.

This workshop is open to all: graduate students, postdocs, faculty, lecturers, and external researchers––and no prior programming experience is required or expected. By the end of this workshop, FAR students (along with other experienced R users) will be able to attend either of the Advanced workshops (AFAR Grouped and AFAR Latent).\nGoals: Provide students with 1) an understanding of the fundamental concepts of scripting and programming using the R language 2) a set of concrete skills and resources for harnessing the power of R for tidying, visualizing, and modeling social science data. The emphasis will be on using R as a tool for analyzing and understanding data rather than on the details of statistical techniques.\nStructure: This workshop is primarily organized around online activities, blending asynchronous lessons with daily synchronous class discussion. The workshop employs active learning techniques to get participants programming and solving problems as quickly as possible. During asynchronous portions, participants will work on programming exercises, while both instructors check student progress and provide assistance. The workshop is led by two instructors with extensive R and teaching experience and will be limited to only 50 students to ensure an active and supportive learning environment for all. Resources will be provided to participants to summarize what was covered during the day and provide tools for further study."

    "title": "Desirable Difficulties in Math Teaching",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog post was originally published on the Psychology in Action blog in February 2011.\n\n\nContinuing in the spirit of my last post, which overviewed the desirable difficulties literature, and Carole Yue’s recent post on how desirable difficulties can improve induction tasks, today I’m highlighting some recent research on applying such difficulties to math learning and practice. As a quick recap, desirable difficulties are adjustments to teaching that slow down learning in the short term, but improve long-term retention. In other words, making learning harder can actually make it more effective. Two of the most robust desirable difficulties are spacing (the distribution of practice sessions over time as opposed to massing them together) and interleaving (alternating practice on different types of problems, like ABCABC, as opposed to blocking them, like AABBCC). Recently, psychologists have begun expanding research on these techniques to conceptual subjects like math.\n\nEvidence for Benefits of Spacing and Interleaving Math Problems\nIn a series of experiments (Rohrer & Taylor, 2006; Rohrer & Taylor, 2007; Taylor, 2008; Rohrer, 2009; Taylor & Rohrer, 2010), Rohrer and Taylor have consistently demonstrated that interleaving and spacing both benefit later performance on math problems. For example, Rohrer and Taylor (2006) instructed subjects on how to solve permutations with repeating elements. Half of the subjects (massers) did 10 practice problems in one session while the other half (spacers) had two different 5 problem sessions. Subjects were tested either 1 or 4 weeks after their final practice session. For those who were tested after 1 week, there was no significant difference between massers and spacers, but after 4 weeks the spacers did much better than the massers. In another experiment (2007), subjects were taught how to find the volume of four different obscure geometric figures. The practice problems were either blocked by type (one figure at a time) or interleaved; each group had two practice sessions a week apart, and then were tested one week after the second practice. They found that during the first practice session, the interleavers performed much worse, while during the second session, the disparity narrowed but blockers still did better. Critically, after being tested at a one week delay, interleavers drastically outperformed blockers (63% to 20%).\nA recent study by Rickard, Lau, & Pashler (2008) utilized spacing and interleaving in an interesting way. Their experiment made use of a unique aspect of mathematics: there are two ways to solving problems––by calculation (process) or by direct retrieval of the answer (memory). For instance, if you have your multiplication tables memorized, you would use direct retrieval (upon seeing 6 x 4, 24 “pops” into your head). But if you couldn’t freely recall the answer, you would use the procedures of multiplication to calculate it. In this sense, repeating the same math problem leads not only to more correct responses, but to faster response times (RTs), because memory is quicker than calculation. In Rickard et al.’s experiment, subjects studied 24 different multi-digit multiplication problems, each of which they repeated 15 times. Some subjects were given the problems in 8 blocks of 3 (repeating 3 different problems 15 times each before moving to the next block of 3), and the other half completed the problems in 2 blocks of 12. The subjects who had larger set sizes (12) made more errors and had longer RTs during the training session, but they outperformed the smaller set size (3) group on a test given after a delay. This suggests that training on small problem sizes allows people to rely on direct retrieval early on (it’s easier to remember 3 things at a time than 12), and they don’t get the full benefit from calculating answers multiple times. Indeed, in a follow-up, they found that while subjects with small set sizes relied much more on direct retrieval during training, those with larger set sizes were actually able to use more direct retrieval after a 2-day delay. This helps illustrate why it is that practicing material that is “fresh on your mind” provides minimal benefits: the immediate accessibility of an answer means that further practice isn’t engaging any actual conceptual/computational processes.\n\n\nImplementing Desirable Difficulties into Math Curricula\nSo what do these results mean for practical changes to math education? The demonstrated benefits of spacing and interleaving greatly challenge the typical format of math lesson plans and textbooks, which typically structure homework assignments around repeatedly practicing a recently learned skill or problem type. By massing the same kinds of problems together, students’ performance within a single class or homework assignment might improve, but it won’t benefit their long-term retention of those skills. Rohrer and Taylor (2007) have argued that textbooks with a shuffled format (interleaved/spaced practice) are better than the standard format of most math textbooks. A shuffled format, they suggest, would be structured such that “after a lesson on the quadratic formula, the immediately following practice set would include no more than a few quadratic formula problems, with other quadratic formula problems appearing in subsequent practice sets with decreasing frequency” (2007, p. 482). This would ensure that practice problems within a set would be a mixture of previous problem types, and practice for a given topic would be spaced throughout the textbook. The beginning of a textbook could interleave topics covered in previous years. Rohrer and Taylor mention that a well known example of a shuffled format textbook is the Saxon series. I perused a sample of their Algebra 1 textbook online, and I’m very impressed with their use of interleaving.\nAs a former math tutor, one of the most common problems I’ve encountered is that students might actually know the formulas for finding, say, the volume of common 3-dimensional shapes, but they sometimes struggle with remembering which formula applies to which shape––and that’s exactly what they need to do on a test. This is likely because they don’t do enough mixed practice, which necessarily involves remembering which formula to apply for each problem. Yet think about a typical textbook chapter or classroom lesson plan on volume. The students might first learn the simplest example: rectangular prisms. After a 20-problem worksheet on rectangular prisms, they might move onto other prisms, then cylinders, then pyramids, cones, and finally spheres. At each step, problem sets involve primarily the shapes just learned. In all of the geometry textbooks I’ve seen, this has been the case. Some textbooks have periodic mixed reviews, but that’s an exception, not the rule. If textbooks interleaved problems systematically, students would always need to decide which formula or type of computation to use for the problem.\nOne important consideration is that the standard format that most textbooks utilize might be so common because as teachers we like to have material organized into modular lesson plans. It might be convenient for us, and students might prefer it because topics are more delineated; they also might notice their performance improving through a 20-problem set. However, we have to be aware that after the first few practice problems, each additional problem may provide very little benefit (a sort of law of diminishing returns). In contrast, if we restructured lesson plans and textbooks to utilize more desirable difficulties like spacing and interleaving, students might actually learn better and remember things longer. Perhaps the best news is that shuffling problems is cost-effective, and wouldn’t necessitate rewriting the whole textbook. Authors would merely have to take their existing problems and interleave them throughout the book in an appropriate manner.\nBecause this research is still new, most of these studies have only been carried out in the laboratory with college students. To fully assess the practical benefits of spacing and interleaving, subsequent research should analyze how these desirable difficulties affect actual learning in practice. Importantly, scientists and teachers need to work together to test these hypotheses in the classroom. Hopefully, with more research like this and open dialogue between scientists, teachers, and textbook writers, we can restructure math teaching to improve learning.\n\n\nCitations\n\nRickard, T.C., Lau, J.S., & Pashler, H.
